## Simple equivalent words
Transforms one English word *v* into another word *w* by going through a series of intermediate English words, where each word in the sequence differs from the next by only one substitution (1 character).

## Generalized equivalent words
An algorithm which solves a generalization of the Equivalent Words problem when insertions, deletions, and substitutions are allowed (rather than only substitutions).

# NucleoPebble - the game
Two players play the following game with a nucleotide sequence of
length n = nA + nT + nC + nG, where nA, nT, nC and nG are the
number of A,T,C and G in the sequence. At every turn a player
may delete either one or two nucleotides from the sequence. The
player who is left with a uni-nucleotide sequence of an arbitrary
length (i.e., the sequence containing only one of 4 possible
nucleotides) loses.

Who's gonna win? You or the computer?
